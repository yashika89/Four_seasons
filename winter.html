        <p>
          Winter is one of the four seasons and the coldest time of the year.
          The days are shorter and the nights are longer. Winter comes after
          autumn and before spring. Winter begins at the winter solstice. In the
          Northern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually December 21 or
          December 22. In the Southern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually
          June 21 or June 22. Some animals hibernate during this season. In
          temperate climates there are no leaves on deciduous trees. People wear
          warm clothing and eat food that was grown earlier. Many places have
          snow in winter, and some people use sleds or skis. Holidays in winter
          for many countries include Christmas and New Year's Day.
