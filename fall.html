          Autumn, also known as fall in North American English is one of the
          four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the
          transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere)
          or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration
          of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools
          considerably. Day length decreases and night length increases as the
          season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern
          Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features
          in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves
          of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.
