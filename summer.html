        <p>
          Summer is one of the four seasons. It is the hottest season of the
          year. In some places, summer is the wettest season (with the most
          rain), and in other places, it is a dry season. Four seasons are found
          in areas which are not too hot or too cold. Summer happens to the
          north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year. In
          the north part of the world, summer takes place between the months of
          June and September, and in the south part of the world, it takes place
          between December and March. This is because when the north part of the
          Earth points towards the Sun, the south part points away.
